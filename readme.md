# GameHub
For this project I was tasked with creating a simple online store using basic css and html. 

It contains:

- main page
- games page
- product page
- shopping basket page
- checkout page
- about us page
- contact us page

## Description

My first attempt at creating an online store using basic css and html. I needed a main page, page to display the games, a single product you could click on and display, a way to simulate adding it to a shopping basket and purchase it As well as an about us and contact us page. I was provided with image assets and a few bits of information about the store but had to create my own text for most of the project. The project is designed to be responsive across most screen sizes as well as mobile devices.

This project is an exercise in design and design implementations, creating a website that's responsive and follows wcag guidelines as well as being as bug free as possible.

The design was based on an initial prototype created in figma. The design being focused on appealing to young adults who would be playing video games.
